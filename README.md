This project visualises how many gun deaths occurred in each of the cities across United States over the years 2012 and 2013. The libraries that are used in the project are D3.js, mapstarter, pandas.
The dataset containing the boundaries of the US states has been downloaded from the mapstarter and combined with the gun deaths dataset and preprocessed to obtain the accurate number of gun deaths in each city across United States. D3.js was used to visualise the obtained statistics with appropriate colour coding representing the number of deaths occurred(e.g: male and female) in each city. The colour coding was done from the d3 chromatic and sequential scales references.
